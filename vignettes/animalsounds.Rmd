# Animal Sounds Test Package

This package contains a single function, `animal_sounds`. It was developed as part of the Forwards R Package Development [workshops](https://forwards.github.io/package-dev/).

The `animal_sounds` function takes two arguments:

-   `animal`: character, the name of an animal
-   `sound`: character, the sound made by the animal

```{r setup}
library(animalsounds)
```

```{r example1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
animal_sounds("cow", "moo")
```

The `sound` argument is optional.

```{r example2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
animal_sounds("polar bear")
```
